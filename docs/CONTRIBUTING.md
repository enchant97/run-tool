# Contributions
This project is open to contributions! So long as the simple rules are followed:

- Check existing contributions (open issues and pull requests) before posting your own
- Contributions must be licensed under the same as the project
- Make titles and commit messages clear, e.g. "changed x to allow for y"
- Fits the project goals & non-goals


## Modifying Checks
- When adding a new check it should be positive e.g. "path exists" not "path missing", this allows for uniform checks since the user can set "invert" field.
- Adding new fields is permitted
- Removing fields unless they are deprecated is not permitted
